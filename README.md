# Binary Operations Between Images
The aplication takes tow bmp files and generate in a new directory all bmp files created from binary interactions between them.  
Operations Between Pixels: 
  1. NOT
  2. AND
  3. OR
  4. XOR
  5. NAND
  6. NOR
  7. XNOR
Operations in the smame file:
  8. SHIFT LEFT  - 8.1 - All pixel values with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits
                 - 8.2 - Only the red value with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits
                 - 8.3 - Only the blue value with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits
                 - 8.4 - Only the green value with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits.
  9. SHIFT RIGHT - 9.1 - All pixel values with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits
                 - 9.2 - Only the red value with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits
                 - 9.3 - Only the blue value with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits
                 - 9.4 - Only the green value with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits.
   
 After I apply the shift operator for a image, i generate all posibile intaractions with the second image.
