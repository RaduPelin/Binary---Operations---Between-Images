# Binary Operations Between Images
The aplication takes tow bmp files and generate in a new directory all bmp files created using binary pixel interactions between them.  


Input Files:

A. Operations between images: 

    1. AND
    2. OR
    3. XOR
    4. NAND
    5. NOR
    6. XNOR
    
B. Operations in the smame file:

    7. NOT (within the image)
    8. SHIFT LEFT  
        8.1 - All pixel values with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits
        8.2 - Only the red value with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits
        8.3 - Only the blue value with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits
        8.4 - Only the green value with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits.
    9. SHIFT RIGHT
        9.1 - All pixel values with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits
        9.2 - Only the red value with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits
        9.3 - Only the blue value with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits
        9.4 - Only the green value with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits.
