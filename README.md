# Binary Operations Between Images
The aplication takes two bmp files and generates all the supported results that came from the pixel binary interactions between images or within each image.  


Input Files:

## Image 1
![FIRST](https://github.com/RaduPelin/Binary-Operations-Between-Images/blob/master/FILE1.jpg)

## Image 2
![SECOND](https://github.com/RaduPelin/Binary-Operations-Between-Images/blob/master/FILE2.jpg)

## A. Operations between images: 

### 1. Image 1  AND  Image 2
![AND](https://github.com/RaduPelin/Binary-Operations-Between-Images/blob/master/AND.jpg)

### 2. Image 1  OR Image 2 
![OR](https://github.com/RaduPelin/Binary-Operations-Between-Images/blob/master/OR.jpg)

### 3. Image 1 XOR Image 2
![XOR](https://github.com/RaduPelin/Binary-Operations-Between-Images/blob/master/XOR.jpg)

### 4. Image 1 NAND Image 2
![NAND](https://github.com/RaduPelin/Binary-Operations-Between-Images/blob/master/NAND.jpg)

### 5. Image 1 NOR Image 2
![NOR](https://github.com/RaduPelin/Binary-Operations-Between-Images/blob/master/NOR.jpg)  

### 6. Image 1 XNOR Image 2 
![XNOR](https://github.com/RaduPelin/Binary-Operations-Between-Images/blob/master/XNOR.jpg)    

## B. Operations in the smame file:

### 7. NOT (within the image)
#### E.g.: NOT Image 1
![NOT](https://github.com/RaduPelin/Binary-Operations-Between-Images/blob/master/NOT.jpg)    
### 8. SHIFT LEFT  
    8.1 - All pixel values with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits
    8.2 - Only the red value with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits
    8.3 - Only the blue value with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits
    8.4 - Only the green value with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits.
#### E.g.: Image 1 Shift Left Blue Colour 2 bits
![LEFT](https://github.com/RaduPelin/Binary-Operations-Between-Images/blob/master/BLUELEFT2.jpg)    
### 9. SHIFT RIGHT
    9.1 - All pixel values with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits
    9.2 - Only the red value with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits
    9.3 - Only the blue value with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits
    9.4 - Only the green value with 1, 2, 3, 4 bits.
#### E.g.: Image 1 Shift Right Blue Colour 2 bits
![RIGHT](https://github.com/RaduPelin/Binary-Operations-Between-Images/blob/master/BLUERIGHT2.jpg)
